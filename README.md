# Traffic_Light_Controller ðŸš¦
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a traffic light controller using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This project aims to utilize its features to control a traffic light system with two operational modes: Automatic and Manual. In the Automatic mode, the traffic lights will operate based on a predefined timing sequence displayed on 7-segment LEDs, while in the Manual mode, the user can manually switch between two streets.
The timing in Automatic mode: West street (15s Red, 3s Yellow, 20s Green), South street (23s Red, 3s Yellow, 12s Green).
